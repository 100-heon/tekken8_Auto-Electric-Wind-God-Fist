 Using Arduino Leonardo and Python for Automated Electric Wind God Fist in Tekken8

Tekken is a 60 FPS game.

In Tekken 8, there is a move called "Electric Wind God Fist."

To execute this move, keyboard or joystick inputs need to be registered simultaneously within a single frame.

This means the inputs need to occur within 1/60 = 0.01667 seconds.

According to this move chart, you need to press the down and forward keys while hitting RP simultaneously.

This has been implemented with Python code.

Just running the Python script triggers the Arduino to operate.

If you open the Arduino file, you'll see the code is set up correctly for the inputs.
